eln (1.1.4-1) trusty; urgency=medium

  User-visible changes: 
  
  * Icon bars now hide when mouse leaves window. This fixes the bugs relating to per-view mode settings.
  
  * Ctrl-Period now restores inadvertent super/subscript.
  
  Implementation changes: 
  
  * Indexing overhauled. Now much more reliable.
  
  * BookData no longer uses or updates endDate. FrontScene uses TOC to calculate endDate. This means that book.eln will no longer cause merge conflicts.
  
  
  Bugs fixed:
  
  * Tables cannot be split across sheets, but navigation bugs fixed. Central problem was that handleSheetRequest did not get connected for TableBlocks.
  
  * Fixes to Assert and CrashReport: Assert::crash now actual quits the application. CrashReport does not fork for Debug version: forking kept gdb from working right.
  * Mode is now part of Notebook
  * LateNotes now create their own ResManagers
  * Bugfix to gotoEntryPage by UUID. Improvements to new event view code.
  * Entirely new approach to event views. Works better.
  * Added "-novc" flag to disable VC for debugging purposes
  * All dialogs now use Translate for "eln"; Assertions cleaned up; CrashReport now actually works (at least in Linux).
  * Now includes build date in version number if minor is odd

eln (1.1.0-1) trusty; urgency=medium

  User visible changes:
  
      SplashScene now works much better at HiDPI
  
      Navbar hides >> and >| on last page; > is replaced by +. TOC icon now goes to last page of TOC.
  
      EntryData now reports when it becomes empty or nonempty. This allows greying/enabling the "+" icon in Navbar.
  
      New context menu on hyperlinks
  
      Slight refinement to note positioning for small notes
  
      Rebuilding TOC automatically renumbers as needed
  
      Modifying an entry on a computer other than the one on which it was made is no longer allowed, except for adding "late notes".
  
      Added a clock face when ELN is full screen.
  
      "Create new notebook" and "Load existing notebook" dialogs now open with better default folder locations.
  
  
  Internal improvements:
  
      "Late notes" are now stored in a separate file to reduce the risk of merge conflicts. The only incompatibility this causes between old and new files and old and new versions of ELN is that old versions of ELN will not display the new-style notes.
  
      Page links are now internally enhanced with a UUID to render them
      immune to renumbering. 
  
      Now converts filename on command line from Windows style as needed.
  
      Several trivial changes to make ELN compile on Android. User interface still leaves a lot to be desired: ELN is clearly not an "app".
  
  
  Bugs fixed:
  
      Footnotes can now be added to secondary sheets of a paragraph. If a footnote is connected to multiple tags, it may appear on any sheet. (That is, it is not automatically moved to the first sheet.) If one tag of a multiply tagged footnote is removed, the footnote is no longer deleted, and it is moved to the appropriate sheet. Unchanged correct behaviors: If a paragraph with multiply tagged footnotes is split, the footnote is copied to both blocks. And if merging blocks results in multiply tagged footnotes, the notes are combined. (If the texts of the notes differ, they are simply concatenated.)
  
      Navbar visibility now correctly updated when moving to front matter. When shift-clicking on Navbar, correct window now jumps.
  
      Blockdateitems were slightly shifted below first line of block. No more.
  SplashScene now works much better at HiDPI
  
      Initial placement of freshly loaded notes now correct

eln (1.0.4-1) trusty; urgency=medium

  Several bugfixes:
  
  * Footnotes now get placed in correct order, even from split paragraphs. Footnotes now get placed on correct sheet, even from split paragrahs and when first visiting entry.
  * Fixed positioning bug for continuation notes
  * I think I got the bug fixed where handleSheetRequest worked in more than one pageview
  * Click in bottom margin once again creates new paragraph
  * TextItem and TextBlockItem now correctly deal with Ctrl-Tab on secondary fragment
  * Added username field to Clone/New dialogs

eln (1.0.2-1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Added GPL text
  * git test now quiet
  * Selection across sheets now works
  * Appling simple styles (e.g., italic) now works with combining diacritics
  * Fixed bug with script styles and combining marks.
  * Rearranged toolitems slightly
  * Added Help button and simple help text.
  * Better spacing in toolbars
  * Removed Goodfish font from icons, now using Ubuntu instead, which is the font used in the rest of the notebook. Goodfish looked baroque in the icons.
  * Mathmode no longer inserts thin space as italic correction nor removes them.
  * An empty first page is now deleted upon abandonment just like any other empty page. Abandonment of empty pages is also triggered when the PageView is closed. If an empty page somehow survives (e.g., due to crash), it is redated when next loaded. (This is important, because otherwise an old empty page at the end of a notebook makes it impossible to create new pages.) When the TOC is empty, it is skipped by nextPage(). (Not by previousPage(), because abandonment has not been responded to when previousPage() is called.)
  * BackgroundVC no longer complains when vc=""
  * Made cursor navigation treat char+combining diacritical as one
  * Replaced Q_ASSERT by ASSERT
  * Added TeX code bar for overbar
  * Improved assertion messages
  * Better crash reporting on segfault
  * Cleaned up assertion implementation
  * Better make install

    archives.
  
  - Improved front scene that makes it clearer what the editable items are.
  
  - Many bug fixes

 -- Daniel Wagenaar <wagenadl@uc.edu>  Mon, 22 Jun 2015 16:39:49 -0400

eln (0.9.0-1) trusty; urgency=medium

  New in this version:
  
  * Improved support for tables
    - Multicellular cut-and-paste
    - Cleaned up user interface for creating/deleting tables/rows/columns
  
  * Improved cut and paste support
    - Cut-and-paste within eln now copies basic styles along.
      - Currently, that applies to bold, italic, and super- and subscript.
      - Other markups like strikethrough are not yet supported.
      - Footnotes are not yet copied.
    - Copying between eln and other applications now tries to maintain
      basic styles (bold, italic, super- and subscript) by importing and
      exporting corresponding html tags.
  
  * Completely overhauled the rendering engine for text
    - Fewer surprises of line spacing changes
    - Immunity against subtle differences between font metrics on different
      machines
    - Regrettably, there is not currently an Undo mechanism. (But this used
      to be somewhat buggy, so it may not be a great loss.)
  
  * New support for automatic footnotes for Pubmed IDs
    - Just type the numeric Pubmed ID, hit Ctrl-N to create a footnote, and
      ELN will reach out to Pubmed to retrieve the citation information.
  
  * Many bugfixes

eln (0.6.1-1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Now uses custom TextItem for all text rendering except on front page.

  * Release tools for debian now complete.
