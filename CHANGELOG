eln 1.0.4

  
  
  Several bugfixes:
  
  * Footnotes now get placed in correct order, even from split paragraphs. Footnotes now get placed on correct sheet, even from split paragrahs and when first visiting entry.
  * Fixed positioning bug for continuation notes
  * I think I got the bug fixed where handleSheetRequest worked in more than one pageview
  * Click in bottom margin once again creates new paragraph
  * TextItem and TextBlockItem now correctly deal with Ctrl-Tab on secondary fragment
  * Added username field to Clone/New dialogs

eln 1.0.2

  
  
  * Added GPL text
  * git test now quiet
  * Selection across sheets now works
  * Appling simple styles (e.g., italic) now works with combining diacritics
  * Fixed bug with script styles and combining marks.
  * Rearranged toolitems slightly
  * Added Help button and simple help text.
  * Better spacing in toolbars
  * Removed Goodfish font from icons, now using Ubuntu instead, which is the font used in the rest of the notebook. Goodfish looked baroque in the icons.
  * Mathmode no longer inserts thin space as italic correction nor removes them.
  * An empty first page is now deleted upon abandonment just like any other empty page. Abandonment of empty pages is also triggered when the PageView is closed. If an empty page somehow survives (e.g., due to crash), it is redated when next loaded. (This is important, because otherwise an old empty page at the end of a notebook makes it impossible to create new pages.) When the TOC is empty, it is skipped by nextPage(). (Not by previousPage(), because abandonment has not been responded to when previousPage() is called.)
  * BackgroundVC no longer complains when vc=""
  * Made cursor navigation treat char+combining diacritical as one
  * Replaced Q_ASSERT by ASSERT
  * Added TeX code bar for overbar
  * Improved assertion messages
  * Better crash reporting on segfault
  * Cleaned up assertion implementation
  * Better make install

eln 0.9.1

  Windows only bugfix release

  * Windows font rendering was always rather ugly due to to horizontal
    hinting which caused very irregular letter spacing.
    By switching to Qt 5.4.2 and forcing freetype font rendering, this
    problem has been solved.

  -- Daniel Wagenaar <wagenadl@uc.edu>  Tue, 09 Jun 2015 09:11:25 -0400

eln 0.9.0

  New in this version:

  * Improved support for tables
    - Multicellular cut-and-paste
    - Cleaned up user interface for creating/deleting tables/rows/columns

  * Improved cut and paste support
    - Cut-and-paste within eln now copies basic styles along.
      - Currently, that applies to bold, italic, and super- and subscript.
      - Other markups like strikethrough are not yet supported.
      - Footnotes are not yet copied.
    - Copying between eln and other applications now tries to maintain
      basic styles (bold, italic, super- and subscript) by importing and
      exporting corresponding html tags.

  * Completely overhauled the rendering engine for text
    - Fewer surprises of line spacing changes
    - Immunity against subtle differences between font metrics on different
      machines
    - Regrettably, there is not currently an Undo mechanism. (But this used
      to be somewhat buggy, so it may not be a great loss.)

  * New support for automatic footnotes for Pubmed IDs
    - Just type the numeric Pubmed ID, hit Ctrl-N to create a footnote, and
      ELN will reach out to Pubmed to retrieve the citation information.

  * Many bugfixes

eln 0.6.1

  * Now uses custom TextItem for all text rendering except on front page.
    This makes us more immune to font changes.

  * Release tools for debian now complete.
