The book as a whole is a bit of a muddle, because it touches on too many different subjects, and several chapters don't speak about children at all.",

(The latter as opposed to merely being taught about the destruction of faraway ecosystems, which may ultimately only instill despondence. Louv cogently argues how this perversely can lead to indifference rather than activism.)",
