ELN is an Electronic Lab Notebook for scientists of all stripes. ELN
is great for:

    Taking notes during experiments since it automatically saves your
    input every 10 seconds so that your notes will never be lost;

    Keeping track of data analysis results since screen shots and
    other graphics can be added to a notebook page by drag-and-drop or
    copy-and-paste;

    Recording your lit searches, since it will automatically download
    papers from PubMed and archive them with your notebook;

    Recording your thought processes, since it will never get in the
    way of your typing with arbitrary constraints of input formatting.

ELN is fairly mature and used daily in our lab. ELN has never caused
anyone to lose any data or notes. To the contrary, since most people
type faster than they can write by hand, ELN has helped people take
more detailed notes than they would otherwise have.

ELN is free and open source and is available for Windows, Mac, and
Linux. Please visit its web page for download details:

Development continues, and your suggestions, bug reports, and
contributions are welcome.
