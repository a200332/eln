In all modes:
- Clicking on the page below lowest block returns to "Type" mode and 
creates new text block

In "Type" mode:
- Clicking on a previous text block edits it
- Clicking on a previous gfxtext edits it
- Clicking on a previous gfx block adds a gfxtext of undef'd width
- Dragging a rectangle on a previous gfx block adds a gfxtext of def'd width
* Editing anything that's older than 24h (?) is not allowed.
* If editing makes a block taller or less tall, everything below it shifts,
  perhaps even across sheet boundaries.
* If a text is abandonded (Esc) with no contents, it is deleted

In "Line" mode:
- Dragging on a gfx block adds a line then adds a gfxtext at the end. If the
  line ended at the left, the gfxtext is right aligned. If the line ended 
  high/low, the gfxtext is bottom/top + center aligned (for some range of
  angles) (?)

In "Arrow" mode:
- Ditto. The start of the drag is the arrow head

In "Dot" mode:
- Clicking on a gfx block adds a dot
- Dragging creates a circle from the center out
- Shift-dragging creates an ellipse from the center out

In "Move" mode:
- Images may be moved within a canvas (drag in center 50%) or resized (drag 
  in any corner or edge)
- Lines and arrows may be moved within a canvas (closest end point is moved)
- Dots may be moved
- Circles may be moved or resized (with shift held)
- Gfxtext objects may be moved or resized (with shift held)
* Canvas auto resizes, up as well as down (after mouse is released)
* Is there a way to change text alignment? Perhaps shift-click gfxtext
* When the pointer is within reach of a movable item, that item glows.
* An item-within-reach may be deleted by presing "Del"

In "Read" mode:
- Click on link follows link

In "Crop" mode:
- Images may be cropped (previously cropped areas appear semitransparent)

Images may be inserted in several ways:
(1) by clicking the camera action button
- The mouse is taken hostage and the first click w/o modifiers on a window
  grabs that whole window; a drag grabs a rectangular area.
* For recognized windows, source information is obtained if possible.
(2) by clicking the import action button
- A dialog appears asking for a filename
(3) by pressing Ctrl-V if an image exists in the clipboard (except when
    editing text)
(4) by dragging an image file into the window

* In all cases, if the lowest block is a canvas, the image is added to
  it; otherwise, a new canvas is made.

Text may be inserted from external applications:
(1) by dragging it into the window
(2) by pressing Ctrl-V if text exists in the clipboard (except when
    editing text)
* Text imported in that way becomes a separate text block colored black
  rather than blue to show that it was imported. Formatting is not
  preserved. When possible, source information is extracted.
